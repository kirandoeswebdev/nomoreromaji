          Well, it's simple. Japanese natives don't think of their alphabet as a
          translation into the Latin alphabet like we do in English; they just
          associate the symbols with pronounciation like we do. Another reason
          is that it's WAYYYYY slower for conversation. Think about it, not only
          are you translating a different language into English (or your native
          language), but your also translating the symbols. It adds another
          buffer to the already slow direct translation process.

          And that was my main reason to create this; no other tool I could find
          offered this. I plan to expand this to kanji and other grammar as
          well, same way native speakers don't think about Japanese grammar,
          they just pick what feels "correct," and creating a context-based tool
          will hopefully help with this.
